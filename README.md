# Build_It_Bigger
### In this project, you will create an app with multiple flavors that uses multiple libraries and Google Cloud Endpoints. The finished app will consist of four modules:

A Java library that provides jokes <br>
A Google Cloud Endpoints (GCE) project that serves those jokes<br>
An Android Library containing an activity for displaying jokes<br>
An Android app that fetches jokes from the GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display<br>
